In this project, we’ll teach you making a simple electronics project, that you can make at home easily. You also can use this project at your home, office, conference room, auto, car, track and other places also.

It is called amplifier circuit. It is very simple, cheap and easy to make. It is powered with DC-12v power supply. 
To make this amplifier circuit, we need some electronics component. First we introduce with that parts.


Component List :
1. Transistor – A 1265n
	        C 2383
		
2. Resistor – 1 KΩ
            330 KΩ
            0.47 Ω (5 Watt)
3. Capacitor – 2200µf/25v
                100µf/25v
4. Mono Volume – B 100K
5. Speaker cable
6. Audio Input Cable
7. Power Source – DC 12v


Transistor Pinout – 

2SA1265n -  is an PNP transistor. As usual this transistor also contain 3 legs. If we count is from left site, then 1st leg “Bass”, 2nd leg “Collector”, 3rd leg “Emitter”.

2SC2383 – is an NPN transistor. As usual this transistor also contain 3 legs. If we count is from left site, then 1st leg “Emitter”, 2nd leg “Collector”, 3rd leg “Base”.

Circuit Connection – 
1st we connect A1265n transistor Collector with c2383 transistor Emitter and connect c2383 transistor Collector with A1265 transistor Base. Now we connect resistor with 330 KΩ resistor. Connect both resistor with both transistor Base leg.

It is the time to connect 100µf/25v capacitor. Connect this capacitor positive leg with Base leg of c2383 transistor.
Now we’ll connect 1kΩ resistor with the circuit. Connect this resistor with negative leg of 100µf/25v capacitor.
To adjust volume of this amplifier circuit, we need a volume/potentiometer. We connect this potentiometer with Collector of A1265 transistor and 1 KΩ resistor.

To protect this amplifier circuit, we use a 0.47 Ω (5 Watt) resistor with the circuit. Connect this resistor with Emitter of A1265 transistor.
Now, we connect 2200µf/25v capacitor with the circuit. It is also a called filter capacitor. We connect this capacitor positive leg with Emitter leg of A1265 transistor. For audio output, we connect speaker cable with the circuit. 

Connect audio output cable with Collector of A1265 transistor and filter capacitor negative leg. To input music, now we connect audio input cable with the circuit. Connect audio input cable with volume. 
For all process, we need  power source. For power source, you can use 12v battery or 12v adapter. Connect DC negative cable with Collector of A1265 transistor and positive cable with empty terminal of 0.47 Ω (5 Watt) resistor.

Before power on, you should careful about the circuit. Because you should remember that, you might need to use heat sink with the transistor.


Now, Just connect audio source with amplifier then play song and enjoy the music.
